Info
-----

This script mounts samba shares. It's intended to be used as
a firefox protocol handler for smb://
It may however be used from any application which supports
protocol handlers or terminal.

Dependencies: smbclient, mount.cifs

You can see it in action here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t58Y_GXT9WM

Instructions 
-------------

mount.cifs needs to run as root, so modify /etc/sudoers and set
passwordless permission for either mount.cifs or this script

This is the sample line that will alow this for members of the
wheel group.

  %wheel        ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/mount.cifs

Firefox protocol HOWTO:
-----------------------

In firefox open about:config and create new _boolean_ property

   network.protocol-handler.external.smb = true

and new string property

    network.protocol-handler.app.smb

Leave this one empty -- for now. Click on some smb link, the format
should be smb://hostname_or_ip/
The dialog will popup asking for external application to launch.
Select this script and check "Remember".

It currently doesn't work with firefox 3.5b4. It is not the issue with 
this script, but rather with how to set it as firefox protocol handler.
